This document will describe the steps performed in order to complete the project.

1) Understanding of the text and assumptions definition.
   Assumptions:
    - All measures are in seconds
    - With 'pending jobs' we consider all the jobs in the system (queues + server). That is, with pending jobs we mean the jobs that have not been dropped and that have still to exit from the system, regardless if they are waiting in a queue or being served in a station.

2) Fitting of the traces distribution.
   This has been done considering the quality of the fitting and the hints given by the coefficient of variation.

3) Conversion of the MMPP measurement units in seconds.

4) Creation of a first model in jmt using open queuing networks.
