1) Definition of a open class.
2) Definition of MMPP arrivals for such class.
3) Insertion of the source node.
4) Insertion of 4 stations, one for each stage.
5) Insertion of the sink.
6) Connection of the components with one another.
7) Definition of the duration of each stage according to the fitted distributions.
8) Definition of a finite capacity region for the 4 stations.
9) Definition of the performance indexes.
10) Using utilization for fine-tuning the model.

After the first run, the following (average) utilizations have been achieved:
Uw = 0.0291
Us = 1.0000
Up = 0.1990
Ui = 0.1796

Also, the average number of customers in each station has been taken into account for considering which station to enhance.

The utilization of Us ih high, could be a bottleneck, let's try to decrease it increasing the number of servers.

The servers in which the utilization was initially quite high have been tuned by hand til the final configuration has been achieved.
